# CLAUDE.md - OK-OFFLINE Ecosystem

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with the OK-OFFLINE ecosystem from the top-level project management perspective.

## Project Overview

**OK-OFFLINE** is a multi-service ecosystem for Burning Man participants, providing offline-first tools for navigation, weather monitoring, and future playa wisdom sharing. This repository serves as the project management and coordination hub.

## Current Architecture

### Service Structure
```
OK-OFFLINE Ecosystem
â”œâ”€â”€ Frontend PWA (okoffline-2025)      # Vue 3 + Vite
â”œâ”€â”€ API Services (ok-offline-api)      # Rails 8 API
â””â”€â”€ Project Management (ok-offline-pm) # This repository
```

### Repositories Status
- **Frontend PWA**: https://github.com/jeremedia/okoffline-2025 âœ… Production
- **Weather API**: https://github.com/jeremedia/ok-offline-api ðŸ”§ In Development  
- **Project Hub**: https://github.com/jeremedia/ok-offline-pm ðŸ“‹ Current

## Working with Claude Code in This Ecosystem

### This Repository's Purpose
- **Cross-service coordination** - Plan features spanning multiple services
- **Architecture documentation** - Document system design and decisions
- **Project management** - Track roadmap, issues, and milestones
- **Development planning** - Coordinate multi-service development

### When to Use This Repository
Use this repository as your Claude Code working directory when:
- Planning features that span multiple services (e.g., Play Wisdom)
- Documenting architecture decisions
- Coordinating between frontend and backend development
- Working on ecosystem-wide concerns (deployment, CI/CD, etc.)

### When to Switch to Service-Specific Repositories
Switch to individual service repositories for:
- **Frontend development**: Use `okoffline-2025` repository
- **API development**: Use `ok-offline-api` repository
- **Service-specific debugging or features**

## Current Development Priorities

### Phase 1: Weather Service Integration (In Progress)
**Priority**: HIGH - Complete the weather service integration

**Status**: 
- [x] Rails API service created
- [x] Apple WeatherKit JWT authentication implemented  
- [x] Frontend weather service integration completed
- [ ] CORS configuration between frontend and API
- [ ] Production deployment

**Next Actions**:
1. Complete CORS configuration in Rails API
2. Test cross-origin requests from Vue frontend
3. Deploy API service to production
4. Update frontend to use production API endpoints

### Phase 2: Play Wisdom Feature (Next)
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Design and implement the playa wisdom sharing system

**Concept**: Enable burners to capture and share practical knowledge through photos, audio recordings, and text notes that sync when connectivity is available.

**Key Requirements**:
- Offline-first capture (photos, audio, text)
- Sync when connectivity returns
- Community moderation system
- Search and discovery features
- Mobile-optimized media capture

**Technical Considerations**:
- File upload and storage strategy (AWS S3)
- Offline sync queue implementation
- Media compression and optimization
- Content moderation workflows

## Service Interaction Patterns

### Frontend â†” API Communication
- **CORS**: Configured for localhost:8000 (dev) and offline.oknotok.com (prod)
- **Authentication**: API key for weather services, future JWT for user features
- **Data Format**: JSON API responses with standardized error handling
- **Caching**: Frontend caches API responses for offline functionality

### Future Service Integration
- **Mobile App** â†” **API**: Same API endpoints, mobile-optimized responses
- **Admin Dashboard** â†” **API**: Extended endpoints for content management
- **Real-time Features**: WebSocket connections for live updates during events

## Development Workflow

### Multi-Service Development
When working across services:

1. **Plan in this repository** - Document the feature or change
2. **Update architecture docs** - Keep ARCHITECTURE.md current
3. **Coordinate implementation** - Update both services simultaneously
4. **Test integration** - Verify cross-service functionality
5. **Deploy coordinated releases** - Ensure compatibility

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Clone all repositories
git clone https://github.com/jeremedia/ok-offline-pm.git
git clone https://github.com/jeremedia/okoffline-2025.git frontend
git clone https://github.com/jeremedia/ok-offline-api.git api

# Frontend development
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev  # Port 8000

# API development  
cd api
bundle install
rails db:setup
rails server  # Port 3000
```

### API Integration Points

#### Weather Service
- **Endpoint**: `/api/v1/weather/current`
- **Method**: POST
- **Payload**: `{ latitude, longitude, dataSets, timezone }`
- **Response**: Weather data with moon phase information
- **CORS**: Must allow requests from offline.oknotok.com

#### Future Play Wisdom API
- **Base**: `/api/v1/wisdom`
- **Endpoints**: 
  - `POST /api/v1/wisdom` - Create new wisdom entry
  - `GET /api/v1/wisdom` - List wisdom entries
  - `PUT /api/v1/wisdom/:id` - Update entry
  - `POST /api/v1/wisdom/:id/media` - Upload media files

## Technology Stack Decisions

### Frontend (Vue.js PWA)
- **Why Vue 3**: Mature ecosystem, excellent PWA support, Composition API
- **Why Vite**: Fast HMR, modern build tooling, excellent dev experience
- **Why IndexedDB**: Robust offline storage, handles large datasets
- **Why Leaflet**: Mature mapping library, BRC coordinate support

### Backend (Rails API)
- **Why Rails 8**: API mode, mature ecosystem, rapid development
- **Why PostgreSQL**: Robust data types, JSON support, full-text search
- **Why JWT**: Stateless authentication, mobile app friendly
- **Why Rack CORS**: Standard CORS handling for Rails APIs

### Deployment Strategy
- **Frontend**: Static hosting with CDN (currently Caddy)
- **API**: Containerized deployment (Docker + PostgreSQL)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated deployment
- **Environment**: Separate staging and production environments

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding a New Feature Spanning Services

1. **Document in this repository**:
   ```bash
   # Create feature specification
   touch docs/feature-specs/new-feature.md
   ```

2. **Update API first**:
   ```bash
   cd api
   # Add routes, controllers, models
   # Add tests
   # Update API documentation
   ```

3. **Update frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend  
   # Add service integration
   # Add UI components
   # Update user flows
   ```

4. **Test integration**:
   ```bash
   # Test cross-origin requests
   # Test offline/online behavior
   # Test error handling
   ```

### Debugging Cross-Service Issues

1. **CORS Problems**:
   - Check Rails `config/initializers/cors.rb`
   - Verify frontend request headers
   - Test with browser dev tools

2. **API Integration**:
   - Check API logs in `api/log/development.log`
   - Verify request/response format
   - Test API endpoints directly with curl/Postman

3. **Authentication Issues**:
   - Verify JWT generation (Apple WeatherKit)
   - Check API key configuration
   - Validate request headers

## Documentation Guidelines

### Keep Current
- Update README.md when adding services or major features
- Update ARCHITECTURE.md when making design decisions
- Update ROADMAP.md as priorities change
- Create feature specs in `docs/feature-specs/` for major features

### Cross-Reference
- Link between repositories in documentation
- Reference GitHub issues across repositories
- Maintain consistent terminology across services

## Deployment and Operations

### Current Infrastructure
- **Frontend**: https://offline.oknotok.com (Caddy server)
- **API**: TBD (planning Docker deployment)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (to be deployed with API)

### Monitoring and Logging
- **Frontend**: Browser error reporting, PWA analytics
- **API**: Rails logs, performance monitoring
- **Infrastructure**: Server monitoring, uptime checks

### Backup Strategy
- **Frontend**: Git repository (stateless)
