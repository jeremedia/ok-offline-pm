# OK-OFFLINE Ecosystem

An offline-first ecosystem for Burning Man participants, providing tools for navigation, weather monitoring, and playa wisdom sharing without requiring connectivity.

## 🌟 Project Overview

OK-OFFLINE is a multi-service ecosystem designed to enhance the Burning Man experience through offline-first technology. The system consists of a Vue.js Progressive Web App, Rails API services, and future components for community wisdom sharing.

## 🚀 Current Features

### Frontend PWA
- **Offline-First Architecture** - Works completely offline once data is synced
- **Interactive Maps** - Leaflet-based maps with BRC coordinates
- **Smart Lists** - Sortable, filterable views of camps, art, and events
- **Personal Schedule** - Build your burn schedule with conflict detection
- **Favorites & Visits** - Track your favorite spots and places you've been
- **Emergency Features** - Store medical info and emergency contacts offline
- **Real-Time Weather** - Dust forecasts and conditions for Black Rock City
